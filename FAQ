What is the format of a :head tag?
 :head followed by a TITLE and a DIRECTION {
 
 example: :head "My Title" LR {
 or :head "My Title", LR {
 
 - TITLE should be in double-quotes eg. "My Title"
 - DIRECTION can be one of LR RL TB or BT

Is the closing brace } needed a the end of a .wdot file?
 Yes.

What is allowed inside a node label?
 Anything this is not a ", eg. "[This is a legal node->label!]"

Why not use dot directly?
 It save a lot of typing.
 with wdot:
  /* My file
   */
  :head "My Title", LR {
  // Nodes
  _s "[Start->here]"
  _e "End"
  a "!Node-A!"
  b [label = "Node B", shape="ellipse"]
  if_ok "Running ?"

  // Links
  _s->a "begin"
  a->if_ok
  if_ok->a "N"
  if_ok->b "Y"
  b->_e [ dir="none"]
  }

 using only dot:
  /* My file
   */
  digraph G {
    graph [ label="My Title", bgcolor="white",
      fontname="Arial", rankdir="LR"]
    node [fontname="Arial", shape="box",
      style="filled", fillcolor="AliceBlue"]
    edge [fontname="Arial", color="Blue",
      dir="forward"]
  // Nodes
  _s [label="[Start->here]", shape="circle",
    fillcolor="LightPink"]
  _e [label="End", shape="circle",
    fillcolor="LightPink"]
  a [label="!Node-A!"]
  b [label = "Node B", shape="ellipse"]
  if_ok [label="Running ?",shape="diamond"]

  // Links
  _s->a [label="begin"]
  a->if_ok [label=""]
  if_ok->a [label="N"]
  if_ok->b [label="Y"]
  b->_e [ dir="none"]
  }
